# Cursor Rules for a2b-brand Project

## Application Startup

**Standard Command for Running the Application:**
```bash
aio app run -e dx/excshell/1
```

This is the recommended approach for running the application. It:
- Automatically enables demo mode in development
- Works with the existing environment configuration
- Avoids dependency issues with cross-env
- Is the primary method documented in all project documentation

## Project Structure

- **Global OpenWhisk micro services**: Stored at `src/actions` folder
- **Source code**: TypeScript in `src/actions_src`, transpiled to `src/actions` when running `build-actions`
- **Actions**: CNCF cloud native functions built using Adobe App Builder on Apache OpenWhisk platform
- **OpenWhisk configuration**: Lives at `./app.config.yaml` under `runtimeManifest` section
- **UI Components**: Adobe React Spectrum components (reference: https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html)
- **Tests**: Store at root `test` folder only

## Demo Mode

- Demo mode is automatically enabled when running `aio app run -e dx/excshell/1`
- Environment variable `REACT_APP_ENABLE_DEMO_MODE=true` is set in `_dot.env`
- Provides mock data and simulated API responses for development and testing
- Visual indicators show "(Demo Mode)" in UI when active

## Development Workflow

1. Use `aio app run -e dx/excshell/1` to start the application
2. Demo mode will be automatically enabled
3. All UI interactions work with mock data
4. No additional configuration required for development

## Testing

- Run tests with: `npm test`
- Tests are stored in the root `test` folder
- E2E tests: `npm run e2e`
